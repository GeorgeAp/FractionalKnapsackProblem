# FractionalKnapsackProblem
The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The most common problem being solved is the 0-1 knapsack problem, which restricts the number x_{i} of copies of each kind of item to zero or one. Given a set of n items numbered from 1 up to n, each with a weight w_{i} and a value v_{i}, along with a maximum weight capacity W
